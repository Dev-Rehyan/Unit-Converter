## Features

- **Convert Units**: Quickly convert between miles and kilometers, and between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- **Interactive UI**: Input fields and buttons to select and convert units, with immediate results displayed on the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Button styling stretches them across the page for easy access on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the input fields, buttons, and display areas.
- **CSS**: Adds a `blueviolet` background, centers text, and styles the buttons to be full-width, changing color and cursor style on hover for an interactive feel.
- **JavaScript**: Includes the `convert()` function, which contains the logic to calculate conversions and display results in real-time.

## How It Works

1. **Select Conversion Type**: Users choose whether to convert distance or temperature units.
2. **Input Value**: Users enter a value in the appropriate input field.
3. **Click Convert**: By clicking the convert button, the app calculates and displays the result based on the selected conversion type.

3. Enter the value to be converted.
4. Click the "Convert" button to display the result.
